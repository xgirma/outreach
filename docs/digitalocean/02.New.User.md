# New User

"The root user is the administrative user in a Linux environment that has very broad privileges. Because of the heightened privileges of the root account, you are actually discouraged from using it on a regular basis." Create `none root user`.


First login a `root` user. As described in [TODO]()

    $ adduser new_user_name

## Set Up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy Server

"Now that your application is running, and listening on localhost, you need to set up a way for your users to access it. We will set up the Nginx web server as a reverse proxy for this purpose."

        $ sudo apt-get update
        $ sudo apt-get install nginx
        
## Adjust the Firewall

        $ sudo ufw app list
        $ sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
        
## Check your Web Server

        $ systemctl status nginx
        
Alternatively, go to your browser and add `your_server_ip` or your domain name `http://gedam.org/` you should get `Welcome to nginx!` ... 


## Manage the Nginx Process
Now that you have your web server up and running, we can go over some basic management commands.

To stop your web server, you can type:

    $ sudo systemctl stop nginx
    
To start the web server when it is stopped, type:

    $ sudo systemctl start nginx
    
To stop and then start the service again, type:

    $ sudo systemctl restart nginx
    
If you are simply making configuration changes, Nginx can often reload without dropping connections. To do this, this command can be used:

    $ sudo systemctl reload nginx
    
By default, Nginx is configured to start automatically when the server boots. If this is not what you want, you can disable this behavior by typing:

    $ sudo systemctl disable nginx
    
To re-enable the service to start up at boot, you can type:

    $ sudo systemctl enable nginx

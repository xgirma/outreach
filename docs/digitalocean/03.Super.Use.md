# Super User

"To avoid having to log out of our normal user and log back in as the root account, we can set up what is known as "super user" or root privileges for our normal account. This will allow our normal user to run commands with administrative privileges by putting the word `sudo` before each command.." make the none-root-user `super-user`.


First login a `root` user. As described in [SSH](https://github.com/xgirma/outreach-admin/blob/master/docs/digitalocean/01.SSH.md)

    $ gpasswd -a new_user_name sudo

# Domain Name System
"DNS (Domain Name System) is a naming system that maps a server's domain name, like example.com, to an IP address, like 203.0.113.1. This is what allows you to direct a domain name to the web server hosting that domain's content, for example."

First buy a domain name from `Google Domains` or others.

Lookup your domain registration using ICANN, e.g. lookup for `gedam.org`

    `https://whois.icann.org/en/lookup?name=gedam.org`
    
1. Sign in to your Google Domains account.

2. Select the domain name that you want to use with your Droplet.

3. At the top of the screen, click on the icon that represents Configure DNS.

4. Click on Use custom name servers.

5. Enter the following nameservers:

        ns1.digitalocean.com
        ns2.digitalocean.com
        ns3.digitalocean.com
        
6. Select `Save` to apply your changes. Now you are ready to move on to connecting the domain with your Droplet in the DigitalOcean control panel.

test: 

        $ whois gedam.org
        
In Digitalocean 

1. Goto the `Netwrkworking` section. enter domain name

2. `gedam.org` and press `Add Domain`
